# HTML & CSS Course _by SuperSimpleDev_

The main goal of completing this course is to gain solid fundamentals in HTML & CSS.
To be specific, I'm mainly interested in:
- Nested Layout Techniques in CSS
  - CSS Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - Using Absolute and Relative positioning
- The HTML Structure

Aside from this, other objectives or benefits I hope to achieve are:
- To begin becoming familiar with looking up problems online
- To begin becoming familiar with reading documentation

The course, at the very least, should expose me to the concepts and literally seeing them in application<br>
so to take it one step further, I will challenge my self to replicate several popular websites with HTML & CSS.<br>
Without practice, these concepts can't be said to be solidified.

These are the sites to be cloned with HTML & CSS for practice:
